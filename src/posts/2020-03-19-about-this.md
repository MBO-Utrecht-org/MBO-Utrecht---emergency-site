MBO Utrecht contributes to the education and growth of students into self-confident professionals. Students learn how to practice a profession, but we also invest in developing talent, work and entrepreneurial skills, social involvement, respect for each other, and citizenship. These choices are anchored in our mission and vision. The five spearheads of our organization are:

* Ambitious education
* Personal attention
* Driven communities
* Entrepreneurial collaboration
* Learning teams

*Ambitious education*
By means of personal contact with our students and partners, we connect contemporary and high-quality education to developments in the area.

*Personal attention*
At MBO Utrecht, students can count on respect, personal attention and safety, because these values ​​are anchored in our interconfessional identity. MBO Utrecht offers a small-scale learning and working environment so that students quickly feel involved and connected.

*Driven communities*
With us, you can be who you are and really be part of our community, where valuable encounters take place and mutual differences are appreciated. Students and employees feel safe and experience the feeling that they can mean something to others, to the neighborhood, and to the world around them.

*Entrepreneurial collaboration*
At MBO Utrecht, we work on developing knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behavior of students. There is space and appreciation for new initiatives and ideas. Students can develop and gain practical experience, for example, in one of our own training companies, which are at the heart of society.

*Learning teams*
Within MBO Utrecht, teams form an inspiring learning environment for every employee, and learn from each other. Teams strive (not only for themselves, but also together) for continuous improvement of student performance and support processes.
